This Visual Studio solution contains a single lib project SQLiteX providing 
a simple c++ wrapper for SQLite that is similar to the MFC database 
classes CDatabase & CRecordset. Currently only some basic features are implemented.

Please add manually the required SQLite source files sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h

The licence for this wrapper is the same as for SQLite.
