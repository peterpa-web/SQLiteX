This Visual Studio solution contains a single MFC lib project SQLiteX providing 
a simple c++ wrapper for SQLite that is similar to the MFC database 
classes CDatabase & CRecordset. Currently only some basic features are implemented.

Please add manually the required original SQLite source files sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h
to the project folder SQLiteX by downloading the amalgame source zip from sqlite.org

The provided MFC project SampleDlgApp shows most features of the wrapper. 
Please feel free to extend it.

The licence for this solution is the same as for SQLite.
